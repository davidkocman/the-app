/**
 * Navigation guard to ensure that a user is authenticated before accessing a route.
 * 
 * This function checks if the current user is authenticated by invoking the `currentUser` method
 * from the `userStore`. If the user is authenticated, the navigation proceeds to the requested route.
 * Otherwise, the user is redirected to the login page (`/login`).
 * 
 * Additionally, it sets the `loading` state in the `appStore` to `true` while the authentication
 * check is in progress and resets it to `false` after the check is complete.
 * 
 * @param _to - The target route being navigated to.
 * @param _from - The current route being navigated away from.
 * @param next - A function to resolve the navigation. Call `next()` to proceed, or pass a route
 *               path (e.g., `/login`) to redirect.
